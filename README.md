# Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting

Forecast future traffic to Wikipedia pages

## Getting Started

This Project is about predicting the future behaviour of time seriesâ€™ that describe the web traffic for Wikipedia articles. The data contains about 145k time series and comes in two separate files: train_1.csv, train_2.csv holds the traffic data, where each column is a date and each row is an article, and key_1.csv , key_2.csv contains a mapping between page names and a unique ID column (to be used in the submission file).

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import re
%matplotlib inline
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
import warnings
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
